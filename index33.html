	<h1><u>The Satellites</u></h1>
	<p>NASA has sent many satellites in space. The first satellite they launched was Explorer 1 in 1958. It was the first man-made satellite and the first satellite picture of the Earth came in 1959. These satellites are very useful and helpful, because the scientists can use the information to study other things. And to make newer and better devolpments. The satellites provides information about the oceans, land, clouds, and air. It can also see if they are volcano eruptions, smoke, wildfires, and other dangerous things. This is how the scientists predict the weather and the climate. It gives us warnings if any emergencies might happen and so we can be prepared. The satellite does many things that help us a lot. They are differnt satellites that we have like, a satellite to see the rays of the sun, to see stars, planets, asteriods, and comets. Some of the satellites names are the International Space Station, Aqua, Terra, Calipso, Suomi NPP, Juno, Aura, Hubble Space Telescope, and a lot more. They are many satellites out there that gives us a lot of information.</p>
