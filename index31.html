	<h1><u>The Astronauts</u></h1>
	<p>They are many astronauts in NASA across the years! Alan Bartlett Shepard Jr. was the first American astronaut and the first one to travel to space in 1961. Neil Armstrong was the first man that walked on the moon. Kalpana Chawla was the first Indian woman in space! NASA has 48 astronauts that are now active and 18 that are management astronauts. 135 astronauts have been to space and sadly 14 of them died. They met in accidents while they were in space. The astronauts train a lot when they plan to go to space and they put a lot of work and effort. They spend years training and preparing.
