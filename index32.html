	<h1><u>The Rockets</u></h1>
	<p>NASA has made rockets to launch the satellites into space. They have a Launch Service Program(LSP) and which they are responsible for launching spacecrafts to discover more about the Earth. NASA has built and launched 166 rockets. NASA's launches have failed over 160 times. Some of NASA's rockets are Vanguard, Saturn V, Atlas, Thor-Able, Scout, and way other more! </p>
	<h2><u>How does NASA use Rockets?</u></h2>
	<p>In the early days NASA used rockets that were built by the military for missions. One of the famous astronauts, Alan Shepard was the first American to space and he flew on the U.S. Army's Redstone rocket. The astronaut that flew on the Atlas Rocket was John Glenn and he was the first American in orbit. The rockets that were used to launch astronauts were Saturn I, Saturn IB, and Saturn V. Which were also used for the Apollo Missions that sent them to the Moon. And the Space Shuttles use Rocket Engines. And this is how NASA send astronauts to space and how they used them!</p>
